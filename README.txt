The program provides a rich amount of functions that can be implemented using the C++ algorithms.

The first part of the project is based on the CSV files that contain information about different dogs. 

The second part of the project is not related to dogs and just provides various functions that can be used with different strings.

The following functions are implemented for the files having information about dogs:
1) loading information about dogs from an input file into a dog multimap
2) outputting information about all the dogs having the specified breed.

The following functions are implemented just for any corresponding nput:
1) trimming whitespaces before or after a word
2) testing if a phrase is a palindrome
3) finding the second largest element
4) counting strings of the supplied length in a vector
5) sorting strings according to their lexicographical order


The following algorithms are used:
1) for_each
2) transform
3) equal_range
4) equal
5) copy_if
6) count_if


The purpose of the program is to practice the following in C++:

1. Standard Library Containers
2. Iterators
3. Algorithms
4. Function objects
5. Lambda functions
